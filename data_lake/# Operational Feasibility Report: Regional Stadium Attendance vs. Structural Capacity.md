# Operational Feasibility Report: Regional Stadium Attendance vs. Structural Capacity
*A Data-Driven Assessment of Nine Selected Venues for Logistical Optimization*

## Executive Summary
The following analysis examines nine stadiums to determine the delta between theoretical capacity and historical attendance performance. Data indicates a significant systemic underutilization of large-scale infrastructure, specifically in the case of Hampden Park, while identifying Bayview Stadium as the sole venue operating at near-peak efficiency.

## Context & Overview
This report provides a logistical audit of nine venues (Stadium IDs 1-10, excluding ID 8) to assist promoters and event planners in risk assessment and venue selection. In the entertainment industry, fixed costs are often tied to total capacity, while revenue is driven by actual attendance. This document reconciles these two metrics to identify operational efficiencies and liabilities across the current dataset.

## Key Findings

### 1. Critical Capacity Underutilization (Hampden Park)
- **Observation**: Hampden Park (ID 4) possesses the highest structural capacity in the dataset at 52,500, yet its historical peak attendance is only 1,763.
- **Implication**: From a logistics perspective, this venue represents a "massive overhead" liability. The highest recorded attendance utilizes only 3.36% of the available infrastructure. Booking this venue for events matching these historical numbers would result in catastrophic financial loss due to security, lighting, and maintenance costs scaled for 52,000+ patrons.
- **Supporting Data**: Stadium ID 4; Capacity: 52,500; Highest: 1,763.

### 2. Maximum Efficiency Anchor (Bayview Stadium)
- **Observation**: Bayview Stadium (ID 3) exhibits the highest seat-fill efficiency in the dataset, with a peak attendance of 1,980 against a capacity of 2,000.
- **Implication**: This is the only venue where demand nearly meets supply (99% utilization at peak). It represents the lowest logistical risk for smaller-scale productions that require a "full house" atmosphere and minimal wasted square footage.
- **Supporting Data**: Stadium ID 3; Capacity: 2,000; Highest: 1,980.

### 3. Mid-Tier Volatility (Stark's Park & Somerset Park)
- **Observation**: Stark's Park (ID 1) and Somerset Park (ID 2) are the only other venues with capacities exceeding 10,000, yet both show significant "empty-seat" ratios.
- **Implication**: Stark's Park is more viable than Somerset Park, maintaining an average attendance of 2,106 (20.8% of capacity) compared to Somerset’s 1,477 (12.3% of capacity). However, both venues require aggressive marketing to justify the use of their 10k+ infrastructures.
- **Supporting Data**: Stadium IDs 1 and 2; Capacities: 10,104 and 11,998 respectively.

### 4. High-Floor Consistency (Lower-Tier Venues)
- **Observation**: Venues with capacities between 3,000 and 4,125 (IDs 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) show remarkably similar attendance patterns, with averages clustered between 552 and 642.
- **Implication**: These venues are interchangeable from a logistical standpoint. If one venue becomes unavailable, the others provide a near-identical footprint for attendance forecasting and staffing requirements.
- **Supporting Data**: Stadium IDs 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. Average attendance range: 552 (Glebe Park) to 642 (Forthbank Stadium).

## Trends & Patterns

### Inverse Relationship Between Capacity and Utilization
There is a clear trend where larger venues suffer from lower percentage utilization. 
- **Evidence**: The venue with the smallest capacity (Bayview, 2,000) has a 99% peak utilization record. The venue with the largest capacity (Hampden Park, 52,500) has a peak utilization record of only 3.36%.
- **Interpretation**: Increased capacity in this specific dataset does not correlate with increased draw. Promoters should avoid "prestige booking" larger stadiums under the assumption that the venue itself will attract a larger crowd.

### High Attendance Skew
In almost every instance, the "Highest" attendance figure is significantly higher than the "Average," often by a factor of 2x or 3x.
- **Evidence**: At Stark’s Park (ID 1), the high of 4,812 is 228% of the average (2,106). At Recreation Park (ID 7), the high of 1,057 is 166% of the average (637).
- **Interpretation**: Historical "peak" events are outliers. Logistics should be planned based on "Average" attendance figures plus a 15% buffer, rather than the "Highest" figures, to avoid over-staffing for non-recurring peaks.

### Attendance Stability in Small Markets
The "Lowest" attendance figures for stadiums with capacities under 5,000 remain consistently above 300.
- **Evidence**: Balmoor (ID 9) has a low of 400; Glebe Park (ID 10) has a low of 315; Recreation Park (ID 7) has a low of 331.
- **Interpretation**: There is a reliable "floor" for these venues. Regardless of the event or conditions, these venues can expect a minimum baseline of ~300-400 attendees, providing a predictable revenue floor for low-tier bookings.

## Addressing Core Questions

### Which venue offers the most optimized environment for a sell-out event?
Based on the metrics, **Bayview Stadium (ID 3)** is the only logical choice for an optimized sell-out. With a peak attendance record of 1,980 against a 2,000-seat capacity, it is the only venue that has proven the ability to operate at 99% capacity. From a logistics view, this maximizes ticket revenue relative to venue rental and operational overhead.

### What is the most significant operational risk identified in the dataset?
The most significant risk is the **Gross Underutilization of Hampden Park (ID 4)**. Utilizing a 52,500-capacity stadium for an event that averages 730 people (1.39% utilization) is an operational failure. The fixed costs of security, ingress/egress management, and facility maintenance for a stadium of that scale cannot be supported by an average gate of 730.

### How do the 3,000-4,000 capacity venues compare in terms of reliability?
The venues in the 3k-4k range (**Forthbank, Gayfield, Recreation, Balmoor, and Glebe Park**) show extreme consistency. Their averages are all within a 90-person range (552 to 642). **Forthbank Stadium (ID 5)** is the top performer in this tier with an average of 642, while **Glebe Park (ID 10)** is the lowest at 552. Logistically, these are stable, low-variance venues.

## Actionable Insights

1.  **Prioritize Bayview for High-Demand/Low-Capacity Bookings**: Given its 99% peak utilization, Bayview Stadium is the primary candidate for events where a "packed" atmosphere is required for filming or brand prestige.
2.  **Impose a "Hard Cap" on Hampden Park Logistics**: Do not book Hampden Park unless the projected attendance exceeds 15,000 (roughly 28% capacity). Historical data (Average 730) suggests that current events at this location are severely misplaced from a logistical standpoint.
3.  **Standardize Operations for IDs 5, 6, 7, 9, 10**: Create a single logistical "blueprint" for venues in the 3,000–4,000 capacity range. Their attendance patterns are sufficiently similar that a standardized staffing and security model can be applied across all five locations to save on planning costs.
4.  **Re-evaluate Somerset Park (ID 2)**: Despite having the second-highest capacity (11,998), its average attendance (1,477) is lower than Stark's Park (2,106). Logistics managers should investigate if Stark’s Park offers better regional transport or facility perks, as it generates 42% more average traffic despite having ~1,900 fewer seats.

## Limitations & Caveats
- **Event Type Anonymity**: The data does not specify the type of events (sporting, musical, corporate). Logistics for a concert differ significantly from a football match due to stage placement and floor access.
- **Temporal Gaps**: There is no timestamp data. We cannot determine if "Lowest" attendance figures are from a specific season or an aging trend.
- **Geography**: While city/location names are provided, the data does not account for local transport infrastructure which impacts "Highest" attendance potential.
- **Missing Entry**: Stadium ID 8 is absent from the dataset, creating a gap in the sequential analysis of regional venues.
