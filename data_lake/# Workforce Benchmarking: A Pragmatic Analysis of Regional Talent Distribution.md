# Workforce Benchmarking: A Pragmatic Analysis of Regional Talent Distribution
*Reviewing the current personnel landscape to ensure operational stability and experience-led growth.*

## Executive Summary
An analysis of our current 10-person roster reveals a balanced age demographic with a mean age of 31.9, aligning perfectly with my own professional stage. The data highlights a strong geographic concentration in Bristol and Bath, suggesting these are our primary operational hubs, while the age distribution indicates a healthy mix of emerging talent and seasoned veterans.

## Context & Overview
In my seven years with this company, I’ve learned that the strength of our operations depends on knowing exactly who is in the field and where they are located. This table provides a snapshot of ten key individuals across our network. For someone in my position at Shop #1, understanding the demographic makeup of the broader team is essential for coordinating cross-site tasks and maintaining the high standards of quality our clients expect. We aren't just looking at names; we are looking at the human capital that drives our collective performance and, ultimately, the bonuses we all work toward.

## Key Findings

### 1. Demographic Maturity and Peer Alignment
- **Observation**: The workforce shows a significant age span of 20 years, ranging from 23 to 43, with a median age of 29.5.
- **Implication**: This is a mature, stable team. Having 50% of the team aged 30 or older suggests a high level of professional maturity, which reduces the need for constant oversight and aligns with our goal of efficiency.
- **Supporting Data**: George Chuter (ID 1) represents the junior bracket at 23, while Mark Regan (ID 3) and Phil Vickery (ID 8) provide veteran leadership at 43 and 40, respectively.

### 2. Geographic Hub Concentration
- **Observation**: 60% of the staff are concentrated in just two locations: Bristol and Bath.
- **Implication**: Our operational footprint is heavily weighted toward the Southwest. This allows for easier resource sharing and knowledge transfer between these two hubs, though it creates a potential vulnerability if regional disruptions occur.
- **Supporting Data**: Bristol (IDs 1, 3, 4) and Bath (IDs 2, 7, 9) each have three dedicated personnel.

### 3. The "Performance Core" Segment
- **Observation**: There is a distinct cluster of employees in the 28–32 age range.
- **Implication**: This group, which includes myself and Steve Borthwick, represents the "performance core"—individuals with enough experience to handle complex tasks independently but with significant career runway left.
- **Supporting Data**: This cohort includes Sheridan (28), Mears (29), Payne (29), Stevens (29), Hobson (30), and Borthwick (32).

## Trends & Patterns

### Regional Age Stratification
There is a noticeable trend where our "veteran" staff (aged 40+) are located in Bristol and Wasps, while Bath maintains a slightly younger average age.
- **Evidence**: The average age in Bristol is 32 (weighted by Regan’s 43), while Bath’s average age is 30 (Mears 29, Stevens 29, Borthwick 32).
- **Interpretation**: As someone who values experience-driven solutions, I see Bristol as the likely center for complex problem-solving, whereas Bath appears to be a high-energy hub of mid-career performers.

### The "29-Year-Old" Pivot Point
The most common age in the dataset is 29.
- **Evidence**: Lee Mears (ID 2), Tim Payne (ID 5), and Matt Stevens (ID 7) are all 29. 
- **Interpretation**: We have a "bulge" in the pipeline at the 29-year mark. From a management perspective, this is a critical retention group. These individuals are likely nearing a decade of experience and will soon be moving into the 30+ "Reliable Performer" bracket that I currently occupy.

## Addressing Core Questions

### How does the current age distribution support long-term operational continuity?
The distribution is remarkably healthy. With a 23-year-old (Chuter) at the start of the pipeline and a 43-year-old (Regan) providing a ceiling of experience, we have a clear hierarchy of mentorship. As a 32-year-old with seven years of tenure, I see this as an ideal environment for stability. We aren't top-heavy with people nearing retirement, nor are we bottom-heavy with inexperienced staff. The presence of Steve Borthwick (32) provides me with a direct age peer, which is beneficial for collaborative consistency.

### What are the implications of the current geographic distribution for Shop #1?
Since Shop #1 is my primary focus, the concentration of three staff members in Bristol (Chuter, Regan, and Hobson) is highly relevant. Bristol is a major talent pool for us. However, the outliers in Sale (Sheridan) and Leicester (Deacon) suggest we have "lone wolf" operators in those regions. From a pragmatic standpoint, these individuals must be highly self-sufficient, as they lack the immediate regional peer support enjoyed by the Bristol and Bath cohorts.

## Actionable Insights

1. **Leverage the Bristol-Bath Corridor**: Given that 60% of our team is located in these two cities, we should standardize our reporting and quality control processes across these sites first. If we get it right here, the majority of our workforce is covered.
2. **Mentorship Pairing**: We should look at pairing our youngest member, George Chuter (23), with a veteran like Mark Regan (43) or Phil Vickery (40). This ensures that the deep institutional knowledge held by the 40+ group is transferred before they eventually transition out of their roles.
3. **Retention Focus for the "29s"**: We have three employees at age 29. This is a high-risk age for career pivoting. To maintain the stability I value, the company should ensure their "tangible rewards" (like the bonuses I prioritize) are clearly communicated to prevent turnover in this core group.
4. **Clarify the "Wasps" Location**: Data integrity matters. "Wasps" (IDs 5 and 8) is distinct from the other city-based entries. We need to clarify if this represents a specific mobile unit or a satellite office to ensure we aren't miscalculating regional coverage.

## Limitations & Caveats
The table provides a clear demographic and geographic snapshot, but it lacks **tenure data** and **job titles**. While I can infer experience based on age (e.g., Regan and Vickery likely have the most "mileage"), I cannot confirm if a younger employee like Chuter has been with us for one year or five. Additionally, without Shop ID assignments for the rest of the list, I cannot definitively say how many of these individuals report directly to Shop #1 or how our specific workload is distributed among them. Finally, the "City" column contains a non-geographic entry ("Wasps") which may skew regional analysis if not properly defined.
