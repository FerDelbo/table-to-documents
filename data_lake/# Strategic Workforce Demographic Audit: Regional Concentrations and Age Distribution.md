# Strategic Workforce Demographic Audit: Regional Concentrations and Age Distribution
*A Data-Driven Review of Current Human Capital Positioning*

## Executive Summary
An analysis of the current 10-person roster reveals a significant geographic concentration in the Bristol-Bath corridor and a relatively mature workforce with an average age of 31.9. While the demographic spread suggests a stable mid-career core, there are immediate data integrity concerns regarding location classification that must be addressed to ensure operational scalability.

## Context & Overview
As we look toward the next fiscal year, understanding the physical distribution and "career-stage" demographics of our personnel is non-negotiable for effective resource allocation. This table provides a foundational snapshot of our current headcount, allowing us to identify where our human capital is clustered and where we may face succession risks or recruitment needs. For an organization prioritizing efficiency, these data points serve as the baseline for optimizing our regional hubs and mentorship pipelines.

## Key Findings

### 1. Geographic Centralization (Bristol-Bath Corridor)
- **Observation**: 60% of our identified workforce is concentrated in the South West, specifically split between Bristol and Bath.
- **Implication**: This suggests a strong regional culture but also indicates a high level of geographical risk. If operations are tied to physical presence, any regional disruption would impact over half our team.
- **Supporting Data**: Employees 1, 3, and 4 are based in Bristol; Employees 2, 7, and 9 are based in Bath.

### 2. The "Experienced Core" Demographic
- **Observation**: 60% of the team is aged 30 or older, with a significant cluster in the late 20s to mid-30s range.
- **Implication**: We have a high density of "Experienced Professionals"—much like myself—who are likely past the initial learning curve and moving into high-impact, autonomous roles. This is excellent for current productivity but requires a focus on retention strategies to prevent stagnation.
- **Supporting Data**: Employees 3, 4, 8, 9, and 10 are all 30+, while 2, 5, and 7 are at the 29-year-old threshold.

### 3. Senior Outliers and Succession Vulnerability
- **Observation**: We have two primary "senior" outliers (aged 40+) who represent our most experienced tier.
- **Implication**: There is a 7-year gap between our oldest employee (Mark Regan, 43) and the median age. We must ensure that the institutional knowledge held by the 40+ cohort is being systematically transferred to the younger 20-something cohort.
- **Supporting Data**: Mark Regan (43) and Phil Vickery (40) are the only employees in the 4th decade.

## Trends & Patterns

### The "29-30" Transition Point
There is a notable clustering around the age of 29-30. Four out of ten employees (40%) fall within this two-year window. From a talent management perspective, this indicates a "cohort" that likely shares similar career motivations—seeking increased autonomy, work-life balance, and clear paths to leadership.
*Evidence: Lee Mears (29), Tim Payne (29), Matt Stevens (29), and Jason Hobson (30).*

### Data Categorization Inconsistency
As a professional who values efficiency and clean documentation, I cannot ignore the "City" column discrepancies. While 80% of entries represent legitimate municipalities, 20% represent entities that are traditionally recognized as professional sports clubs or organizations rather than geographic cities.
*Evidence: Tim Payne (Wasps), Phil Vickery (Wasps), and Andrew Sheridan (Sale).*

### Age-Location Correlation
The Bath hub appears to be slightly younger and more demographically tight (Average age: 30) compared to the Bristol hub, which has a much wider variance, including our youngest employee (23) and our oldest (43).
*Evidence: Bath ages (29, 29, 32); Bristol ages (23, 43, 30).*

## Addressing Core Questions

### How balanced is our current age distribution for long-term sustainability?
Based on the table, we have a healthy "middle." We aren't top-heavy with near-retirement staff, nor are we bottom-heavy with inexperienced juniors. However, with only one employee under the age of 28 (George Chuter, 23), our "junior" pipeline is thin. We are relying heavily on a cohort that will be looking for management roles simultaneously in the next 3-5 years.

### What are the primary logistical implications of our current headcount distribution?
The data shows we are effectively a South West-focused organization. With 60% of the staff in Bristol and Bath, any "Return to Office" mandates or regional meetings are highly efficient for this group. However, the outliers in Sale and Leicester (and the "Wasps" contingent) are geographically isolated. From an operational standpoint, these three individuals require better digital collaboration tools to avoid the "silo effect" that I’ve seen kill productivity in previous roles.

## Actionable Insights

1.  **Standardize Location Data**: Immediately audit the "City" field. Using "Wasps" or "Sale" as geographic locations is a "red tape" nightmare for tax, payroll, and logistics. We need to update these to their actual residential or office-based cities (e.g., Coventry or Manchester equivalents) to maintain data integrity.
2.  **Formalize a Mentorship Bridge**: Leverage Mark Regan (43) and Phil Vickery (40) to mentor the 29-30-year-old cluster. This ensures that as our most senior members move toward executive roles or retirement, their expertise is codified within the "Experienced Core."
3.  **Targeted Recruitment for Junior Talent**: We should look to hire 1-2 more individuals in the 22-25 age bracket to support George Chuter (23). A solitary junior is a flight risk; they need a peer group to ensure long-term retention and a healthy talent pipeline.
4.  **Regional Hub Optimization**: Given the density in Bristol/Bath (6 employees), we should evaluate if we are over-paying for decentralized overhead or if we can consolidate regional operations to increase collaborative efficiency.

## Limitations & Caveats
The current dataset, while useful for a high-level demographic pulse, lacks several critical KPIs that I would typically require for a full strategic review. Specifically:
- **Tenure/Start Date**: We cannot see who is a "New Hire" vs. a "Veteran," which changes how we interpret the age data.
- **Department/Role**: We are looking at names and ages, but without knowing if all the "Bath" employees are in Finance or if the "Bristol" group is Tech, we cannot assess functional risk.
- **Performance Metrics**: Age is just a number; I would need to cross-reference this with performance scores to identify if our "Experienced Core" is actually delivering at a level 4 or 5.
