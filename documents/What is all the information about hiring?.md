To retrieve all information about hiring, you would select all columns from the `hiring` table.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hiring;
```

### Explanation

This SQL query performs the following actions:

*   **`SELECT *`**: This clause specifies that all columns from the table should be retrieved.
*   **`FROM hiring`**: This indicates that the data should be fetched from the table named `hiring`.

Executing this query will return every row and every column present in the `hiring` table, providing a complete overview of all recorded hiring information.
