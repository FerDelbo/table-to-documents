To retrieve all information about hiring, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM hiring;
```

### Explanation

*   `SELECT *`: This clause specifies that all columns from the table should be retrieved.
*   `FROM hiring`: This indicates that the data should be fetched from the `hiring` table.

This query will return every column and every row present in the `hiring` table, providing a comprehensive view of all available hiring information.
