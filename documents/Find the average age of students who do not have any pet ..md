The question asks to find the average age of students who do not own any pets.

The corresponding SQL query to achieve this is:

```sql
SELECT avg ( age ) FROM student WHERE stuid NOT IN ( SELECT stuid FROM has_pet )
```

### Explanation

This query works in two main steps:

1.  **Subquery for Students with Pets:**
    *   `SELECT stuid FROM has_pet`: This subquery identifies all `stuid` (student IDs) that appear in the `has_pet` table, meaning these students own at least one pet.

2.  **Main Query for Average Age of Pet-less Students:**
    *   `SELECT avg ( age ) FROM student`: This part selects the average of the `age` column from the `student` table.
    *   `WHERE stuid NOT IN (...)`: This condition filters the `student` table to include only those students whose `stuid` is *not* present in the list generated by the subquery (i.e., students who do not have any pets).

Combining these, the query calculates the average age exclusively for students who are not listed in the `has_pet` table, thus fulfilling the requirement of finding the average age of students without any pets.
