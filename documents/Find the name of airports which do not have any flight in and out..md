To find the names of airports that do not have any incoming or outgoing flights, we can query the database by identifying airports whose codes are not present in either the `sourceairport` or `destairport` columns of the `flights` table.

## SQL Query to Find Airports Without Flights

The following SQL query achieves this by using a subquery with a `UNION` operator to gather all airport codes involved in flights, and then using a `NOT IN` clause to filter out airports from the `airports` table that are found in this combined list.

```sql
SELECT airportname
FROM airports
WHERE airportcode NOT IN (
    SELECT sourceairport FROM flights
    UNION
    SELECT destairport FROM flights
);
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query

1.  **`SELECT airportname FROM airports`**: This is the main part of the query. It instructs the database to retrieve the `airportname` from the `airports` table.
2.  **`WHERE airportcode NOT IN (...)`**: This clause filters the results. It includes only those airports whose `airportcode` is *not* present in the list generated by the subquery.
3.  **`SELECT sourceairport FROM flights`**: This subquery retrieves all `sourceairport` codes from the `flights` table, representing all airports from which flights depart.
4.  **`UNION`**: This operator combines the results of the two `SELECT` statements within the subquery. It returns distinct rows from both queries, ensuring that each airport code appears only once in the combined list of all airports involved in any flight (either as a source or a destination).
5.  **`SELECT destairport FROM flights`**: This subquery retrieves all `destairport` codes from the `flights` table, representing all airports where flights arrive.

In essence, the subquery first creates a comprehensive list of all airport codes that are associated with any flight. The outer query then selects the names of airports from the `airports` table that are *not* found in this comprehensive list, thereby identifying airports with no recorded flight activity.

## Expected Output

The query will return a list of airport names. Each name in the output corresponds to an airport that does not serve as a departure or arrival point for any flight recorded in the `flights` table.

For example:

| airportname          |
| :------------------- |
| Quiet Haven Airport  |
| Desert Oasis Airstrip|
| Remote Landing Field |
| ...                  |
