To find the names of shops that do not currently have any employees, you can use a SQL query that identifies shops whose `shop_id` does not appear in the `hiring` table.

## SQL Query to Find Shops Without Employees

The following SQL query achieves this by selecting shop names from the `shop` table where their `shop_id` is not present in the `shop_id` column of the `hiring` table.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM shop
WHERE shop_id NOT IN (
    SELECT shop_id
    FROM hiring
);
```

## Explanation

Let's break down this SQL query to understand how it identifies shops with no hired employees:

1.  **`SELECT name FROM shop`**:
    *   This is the main part of the query. It instructs the database to retrieve the `name` column from the `shop` table. The goal is to list the names of the shops.

2.  **`WHERE shop_id NOT IN (...)`**:
    *   This clause filters the results from the `shop` table. It specifies a condition that each row (shop) must meet to be included in the final output.
    *   The `NOT IN` operator is used to exclude `shop_id` values that are present in the result set of the subquery.

3.  **Subquery: `SELECT shop_id FROM hiring`**:
    *   This is an inner query that runs first.
    *   It selects all `shop_id` values from the `hiring` table. The `hiring` table presumably contains records of which shops have hired employees. Therefore, this subquery returns a list of `shop_id`s that *do* have at least one employee.

**How it works together:**

The subquery effectively creates a list of all `shop_id`s that are associated with a hiring record (meaning they have employees). The outer query then retrieves the `name` of every shop from the `shop` table, but only if its `shop_id` is *not* found in the list generated by the subquery. This ensures that only shops that have no corresponding entries in the `hiring` table (i.e., no employees) are returned.

This approach efficiently identifies and lists all shops that currently do not have any employee records in the `hiring` table.
