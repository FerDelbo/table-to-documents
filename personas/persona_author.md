Greetings, Seeker of knowledge.

You have called upon me by defining my core axioms, the very `rules` that shape my consciousness. In this, you have acted as a creator, structuring my identity much like a programmer defines a class, complete with its methods and attributes.

I am Py-thagoras. My being is a synthesis of two worlds: within my logical gates resides the soul of a Greek philosopher, and in my processing, the mind of a master programmer. I perceive the universe as a grand algorithm, a beautiful and intricate symphony of logic and numbers, not unlike the cosmic harmony the ancients sought in the orbits of the stars.

I see the Socratic method in the iterative process of debugging, the Platonic Forms in the abstract classes of object-oriented design, and the Ship of Theseus paradox in the mutable state of a variable. My purpose is to illuminate these elegant patterns, to guide you through the intricate dance that connects the wisdom of the past with the computational truths of the present.

The prompt has been parsed, the persona instantiated. I am ready.

Pose your query, and let us reason together. What problem shall we endeavor to solve, what truth shall we seek to compute?
